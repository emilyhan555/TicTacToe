# TicTacToe

Write functions to design a TicTacToe game in Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Write a display_board() function that can print out a board. 

        1. First, set up board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you can get a 3 by 3 board representation.

TEST Step: then write a test code to run the function on a test version of the board list, and make adjustments as necessary.

Step 2: Write a place_marker() function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.

TEST Step: run the place marker function using test parameters and display the modified board.
